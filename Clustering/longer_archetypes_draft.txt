Abstract


Introduction
In the light of the COVID-19 pandemic many countries are trying to widen their pandemic planning from its traditional focus on influenza. However, it is impossible to draw up detailed plans for every pathogen with epidemic potential. We set out to try to simplify this process by reviewing the epidemiology of a range of pathogens with pandemic potential and seeing whether they fall into groups with shared epidemiological traits.  


Methods 
We reviewed the epidemiological characteristics of 19 different pathogens with pandemic potential (those on the WHO priority list of pathogens, different strains of influenza and Mpox). We extracted data on the proportion of presymptomatic transmission, incubation period, serial interval and basic reproduction number (R0) for the targeted  pathogens. We applied unsupervised machine learning (specifically K-means and hierarchical clustering)  to categorise these pathogens based on these characteristics. . 


Results
Fom 154 articles we extracted 306 epidemiological parameter estimates. The clustering algorithms categorise these pathogens into five archetypes (1) airborne pathogens with high transmission potential, (2) respiratory zoonoses characterized by high case fatality risk, (3) contact zoonoses with high fatality rates, (4) contact zoonoses exhibiting presymptomatic transmission, and (5) vector-borne pathogens capable of secondary human-to-human transmission.
 
Conclusion
Unsupervised learning on epidemiological data can be used to predict distinct pathogen archetypes. This method offers a valuable framework to allocate emerging and novel pathogens into defined groups to evaluate common approaches for their control.

1. Introduction 
Recent global epidemics of COVID-19 and Mpox have illustrated that we remain vulnerable to global biological incidents. Historically, pandemic preparedness strategies have been limited in scope.  For instance, prior to COVID-19, the UK government’s sole pandemic plan was the 2011 Influenza Pandemic Preparedness Strategy [1,2]. This narrow focus left critical gaps in threat readiness that have been exploited by non-influenza pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 and Mpox virus (MPV). 
Given the potential health and economic impacts of pandemics, the way in which we plan for such risks needs to be revised. There are 26 viral families known to infect humans [3], but only a fraction of these viruses will possess the ability for widespread transmission in the community [4]. Historically, this fraction has been listed, based on historical outbreaks and ranked to inform policy makers on which pathogens possess the highest pandemic potential. A list based approach, while useful, is inflexible and is rooted in responding to yesterday's pandemic rather than proactively planning.
Categorising pathogens based on shared epidemiological traits rather than using historical lists offers a more flexible and inclusive framework for pandemic planning [4]. A trait based approach would facilitate proactive planning for emerging threats by categorising pathogens by characteristics, allowing planners to assess a wider breadth of scenarios and control measures  rather than specific historical examples [4].
To address these gaps, we propose classifying pathogens into archetypes based on epidemiological traits. Utilising data collected from reviews, we implement two unsupervised machine-learning models, K-means clustering and hierarchical clustering, to identify relevant pathogen archetypes. By categorising pathogens by their reproduction number, serial interval, case fatality ratio, proportion of presymptomatic transmission and transmission route, we show how pathogens can be grouped by shared characteristics which may point to common approaches for their control.

2. Methods


2.1 Review of epidemiological parameters
We reviewed the human epidemiology of the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) blueprint pathogens (as of June 2024) [5]. Including SARS-COV-2 (Wild type, Alpha, Delta & Omicron variants), Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever orthonairovirus (CCHFV), Ebola virus (EBOV), Marburg virus (MARV), Lassa virus (LASV), MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-1, Nipah virus (NiV), Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) [5]. In addition, we reviewed; pandemic influenza A virus (H1N1, H2N2, H3N2 & H1N1pdm09), influenza A virus subtype H5N1 (A/H5N1) and Mpox virus (MPV). 


Standard search terms were developed based on the review objectives to collect information on epidemiological parameters of pathogens with pandemic potential. We reviewed these pathogens in terms of transmission route and epidemiological characteristics, including the basic reproduction number (R0) and its associated dispersion parameter (k), incubation period, latent period, infectious period, serial interval, presymptomatic transmission, case fatality risk (CFR) and infection fatality risk (IFR). 


Initial searches were conducted in PubMed to identify existing systematic reviews. Search terms used are listed in Supplementary Table S1. Studies were included if they provided quantitative estimates based on primary epidemiological data or meta-analyses of such data. Additional relevant parameters not captured during this search were retrieved via other methods (see supplement). Articles were included if they described and provided estimates of the desired epidemiological characteristics, or provided datasets allowing for parameter estimation. 
2.2 Parameter estimation
We estimated key parameters that were not available from the literature review. Where appropriate, we estimated values for the incubation period, serial interval, R0 and proportion of presymptomatic transmission for selected pathogens. For the incubation period, we used the {EpiLPS} package [6–8] where publicly available data permitted. We estimated serial intervals by fitting lognormal and gamma distributions to the number of onsets for a given day, accounting for double censoring using the R package {primarycensored} [9,10]. For R0, we used the package {epichains} [10,11], to provide an estimate for CCHFV on the basis of data collected by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control [11]. We estimated presymptomatic transmission for all pathogens using published or derived incubation and serial interval estimates, assuming transmission occurred before symptom onset if the mean serial interval was shorter than the mean incubation period. Full methodological details are provided in the Supplementary Information. 


2.3 Clustering of epidemiological parameters 
The primary aim was to identify distinct pathogen archetypes which share similar epidemiological characteristics. For the clustering analysis, where possible, we used pooled values from systematic reviews for R0, serial interval and CFR. Values and justifications are listed in supplementary data. In addition, we included the transmission route and the percentage of presymptomatic transmission. These values were selected as they represent key epidemiological quantities and were available for most pathogens. 


We applied the unsupervised machine learning algorithm, K-means, to the dataset. The elbow method was used to help inform the optimal number of clusters. With the final K value being selected based on the elbow plot and practical interpretability of the resulting clusters.


In addition, hierarchical clustering was applied to the same dataset using Ward’s linkage method. The results were visualised as a dendrogram, with discrete clusters identified by cutting the tree at a predefined level based on elbow plot analysis. Each pathogen was assigned to a cluster according to its hierarchical position, facilitating the identification of subgroups with shared epidemiological traits.


2.3.1 Sensitivity analysis
We conducted sensitivity analyses by modifying the included parameters. Since serial interval estimates are not applicable for pathogens primarily transmitted via vectors, such as RVFV and ZIKV, we performed an alternative clustering analysis where serial interval and the percentage of presymptomatic transmission were excluded. This adjustment allowed us to incorporate RVFV into the clustering framework.
Additionally, we explored whether the clustering approach could be extended to other pathogens by including HIV. The serial interval for HIV is hard to define given that in a  large number of cases the serial interval may be negative [12], in addition the CFR is also highly variable due to differences in access to treatment [13]. We conducted a sensitivity analysis in which we removed both CFR and serial interval. This modification allowed us to assess how HIV might be classified within the existing framework and whether this approach could be generalised to other infectious diseases with different transmission dynamics.

3. Results 
3.1 Parameter review
A total of 154 articles were retrieved (Supplementary Figure S1).  This included 43 articles retrieved through the initial search of systematic reviews and 69 articles obtained from supplementary sources. Among these, one was a grey literature report published by the WHO. 
For the estimation of key epidemiological parameters using the {EpiLPS} package, 28 articles were identified that provided sufficient data for manual parameter calculations. Additionally, 14 articles contributed pre-existing datasets that were incorporated into the analysis. 
3.2 Epidemiological characteristics
3.2.1 Transmission dynamics
We extracted 63 estimates for the reproduction number, which varied across pathogens and outbreaks due to differences in settings and the implementation of control measures  (Table 1). One additional estimate was derived, with the median R₀ for CCHFV estimated at 0.03 (95% CrI: 0.004–0.09) based on cases reported in the European Union between 2013 and 2014.
A total of 15 estimates for the dispersion parameter (k) were extracted, revealing varying degrees of heterogeneity in transmission. SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and NiV exhibited particularly low k values, indicating a high potential for superspreading events, whereas influenza displayed greater uniformity in transmission. Pathogens such as EBOV were reported to have a wide range of estimates suggesting the degree of superspreading may be dependent on outbreak setting (Table 1). 
We also estimated the proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission for pathogens with reported incubation periods and serial intervals. Our analysis suggests that pre-symptomatic transmission was possible for SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, pandemic influenza, MPV, and LASV (Supplementary information). 


3.2.2 Time to key events
We extracted 51 estimates for the incubation period and provided 13 additional estimates based on publicly available data. The length of the incubation period varied across pathogens, with pandemic influenza exhibiting the shortest incubation period. In contrast, pathogens primarily transmitted through contact with infected body fluids, such as LASV, EBOV, and CCHF, had the longest incubation periods (Table 1).
For the serial interval, we extracted 33 estimates. As with the incubation period, serial intervals were shortest for pandemic influenza and SARS-CoV-2 and longest for contact-transmitted pathogens (Table 1). Additionally, we estimated serial intervals for LASV and CCHF, with mean values of 11.5 days (95% CrI: 0.9–34.6) and 12.0 days (95% CrI: 3.0–27.2), respectively. 
For the latent and infectious periods, we extracted 27 and 33 estimates, respectively. These durations showed notable variation between pathogens, highlighting differences in disease progression (Table 1).


3.2.3 Severity and Mortality Risk
We extracted 59 estimates for the case fatality rate (CFR) and 25 for the infection fatality rate (IFR). CFR estimates exhibited a broad range across pathogens, reflecting varying levels of disease severity (Table 1). Additionally, CFR varied within pathogens, with substantial heterogeneity between studies, outbreaks and age groups. For instance, NiV outbreaks with implemented control measures reported lower CFR estimates (Table 1).
Compared to CFR, fewer IFR estimates were reported. IFR values were consistently lower than CFR estimates for the same pathogen and demonstrated age-dependent variation (Table 1)

3.3 K-means clustering
A different number of clusters were modeled (K=1-10)  (Figure 1a). The five cluster solution was ultimately considered the most appropriate according to the elbow method (Figure 1a) as well as heuristically since it sufficiently separates the high consequence infectious diseases (HCID) by transmission route and presymptomatic transmission (Figure 1b). In the final clustering, CCHFV, MARV, EBOV, and NiV were grouped into cluster 1; H5N1 and MERS-CoV into cluster 2; LASV and MPV into cluster 3; SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 (all variants), and all pandemic influenza subtypes (except H5N1) into cluster 4; and ZIKV into cluster 5 (Figure 1c). The characteristics of each archetype are detailed in Table 2.

3.4 Hierarchical clustering
A series of cluster numbers were modelled (K=1-10) (Figure 2a). Hierarchical clustering into five clusters was deemed the most appropriate segmentation of pathogens following the elbow method (Figure 2a) and considering the division of pathogens (Figure 2b). The five-cluster algorithm classified SARS-CoV-2 (all variants), and pandemic influenza (all subtypes) into cluster 1; MARV, EBOV and NiV, into cluster 2; LASV, and MPV, into cluster 3; ZIKV and CCHFV into cluster 4; and A/H5N1, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-1, into cluster 5 (Figure 2c). Table 3 summaries the characteristics of each archetype.

3.5 Archetype characterisation 
3.5.1 Airborne, High Transmission Pathogens
SARS-CoV-2 (all variants), and pandemic influenza are consistently grouped together. This group is characterised by a high R₀, short serial intervals, and variable presymptomatic transmission. These pathogens share an airborne transmission route (Table 2 and 3). Notably, SARS-CoV-1 was grouped with this archetype in the K-means clustering method but classified separately when using hierarchical clustering. When SARS-CoV-1 is classified with this group it broadens the range of serial intervals and CFR’s (Table 2).


3.5.2 Respiratory Zoonoses with High CFR
A/H5N1 and MERS-CoV likewise are consistently clustered together, characterised by a low R₀ and moderate serial intervals , but high CFRs. Unlike the other respiratory archetype, this group has no evidence for presymptomatic transmission. This archetype contains pathogens that are primarily transmitted from animals to humans, with limited human-to-human transmission (low R0).


When hierarchical clustering is used, SARS-CoV-1 was included in this category, suggesting that this pathogen may reasonably be grouped with either archetype. When grouped together, the range of R₀, CFR and proportion of presymptomatic transmission are widened   (Table 3)


3.5.3 Contact Zoonoses with High CFR
Both clustering approaches consistently grouped MARV, EBOV, and NiV together as high-CFR, contact-transmitted pathogens. This archetype exhibit low R₀ values, long serial intervals, and high CFRs (Table 2). This archetype is transmitted via direct contact with infected bodily fluids or animal-to-human spillover.
Although MARV, EBOV, and NiV remained stable in their clustering, the classification of CCHFV varied between methods. This led to differences in the characteristics of the corresponding archetypes (Tables 2 and 3).
3.5.4 Contact Zoonoses with Evidence of Presymptomatic Transmission 
LASV and MPV were consistently grouped together, forming an archetype characterised by low to moderate R₀ values , long serial intervals, and moderate CFRs. These pathogens may exhibit some degree of presymptomatic transmission (Table 2 and 3). 
3.5.5 Vector-Borne Pathogens with Secondary Transmission Routes
ZIKV was identified as a distinct archetype in K-means clustering but was grouped with CCHFV in hierarchical clustering. CCHFV was alternatively classified either with vector-borne pathogens alongside ZIKV or with contact-transmitted pathogens, depending on the clustering method.
Despite these differences in grouping, both approaches consistently identified low R₀ values and long serial intervals for human-to-human transmission. However, when CCHFV is included, the CFR range expands (Table 2 and 3). 
3.5.6 Excluded Pathogens
No human to human transmission has been documented [14] for RVFV, therefore its serial interval is undefined (indeed, it is also difficult to define a serial interval for vector-borne Zika infections) and was not included in the main clustering analysis. When clustering was performed without serial interval and presymptomatic transmission data, and using R0 values from vector-borne transmission, RVFV was grouped with CCHFV (Supplementary Figure S4) or appeared as an independent branch close to the HCIDs (Supplementary Figure S5).


HIV was not included within the parameter review, however using R0 and proportion of presymptomatic values from Fraser et al. 2004 [15]. HIV will form its own archetype (Supplementary figure S6 and 7)

4. Discussion 
We reviewed key epidemiological parameters for 19 pathogens with pandemic potential and applied two clustering algorithms to identify distinct pathogen archetypes that share similar characteristics. Our findings suggest that grouping pathogens based on transmission traits—such as R0, serial interval, CFR, presymptomatic transmission, and transmission route— could provide a pragmatic approach to pandemic preparedness.




The most frequently reported parameters were the incubation period, reproduction number, and CFR. However, data availability was uneven, with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza accounting for nearly half of all estimates. Parameter estimates varied both across pathogens and within studies of the same pathogen, aligning with previous reviews [16]. Notably, R₀, serial interval, and CFR estimates were highly context-dependent. For example, MERS-CoV R₀ estimates ranged from 5.4 (95% CI: 4.61-6.19) in an uncontrolled hospital outbreak to 0.14 (95% CI: 0.04-0.26) with control measures in place (Park et al. 2018). Similarly, influenza A/H1N1 R₀ estimates were higher in confined settings compared to overall estimates [18]. Likewise EBOV estimates varied by country during the 2013-2016 epidemic [19]. Serial interval estimates also decreased when control measures were implemented, with the serial interval of SARS-CoV-2 decreasing post epidemic peak in China correlating with decreased time to isolation (Xu et al. 2023). 


There were considerable differences in CFR estimates between outbreaks of the same pathogen. Influenza A/H5N1 varies by clade [21]. MPV varies when hospital care is available [22] or when comparing outcomes from outbreaks in Africa to outbreaks in the United States (Bunge et al. 2022). Varying estimates for NiV highlights how CFR can vary depending on country, strain and the control measures implemented, with the CFR being lower in Singapore (1999) compared to Malaysia (1998-1999) [25]. These examples illustrate that parameter estimates are generated across a wide range of contexts and the importance of contextualising parameter estimates when applying them to modeling efforts.


Our clustering analysis identified five pathogen archetypes, each with shared characteristics that could inform group-based control strategies rather than a pathogen-specific approach. With the effectiveness of interventions such as contact tracing and case isolation being influenced by R₀ and presymptomatic transmission [15], as well as the serial interval [26]. 


The limitations of this approach include the potential for the grouping of pathogens which may not display similar characteristics in reality. This is particularly seen in the archetype containing LASV and MPV. Presymptomatic spread has been documented for Mpox [27], it however remains uncertain for Lassa fever. Discrepancies in symptom onset reporting in source datasets may have led to an overestimation of presymptomatic transmission for LASV. Additionally, the R0 estimate for LASV is derived from a hospital outbreak  [28] and will not reflect community-level transmission. The clustering of LASV and MPV may imply a higher risk of sustained human-to-human LASV transmission than observed in endemic communities, where transmission is primarily zoonotic with occasional nosocomial outbreaks [29]. These potential discrepancies highlight the need to continually update the parameter estimates used in this framework once they become available. 


These findings highlight the potential for this framework to serve as an adaptable tool for classifying and assessing pathogens beyond those included in this study. The inclusion of HIV in our sensitivity analysis illustrates how this clustering approach could extend to a wide spectrum of infectious diseases with different transmission dynamics. Moreover, the framework could be continuously updated as new epidemiological data emerge, refining clustering methods and integrating additional pathogens, including both novel and emerging threats.

5. Conclusion
Documenting epidemiological parameters is crucial for effective outbreak risk analysis. We provide 342 parameter estimates for 19 pathogens, offering a valuable foundation for modeling their spread and containment. However, key transmission parameters—such as the dispersion parameter and latent period—remain underreported, highlighting the need for further research to strengthen outbreak preparedness. Our clustering approach demonstrates a practical framework for evaluating control strategies across groups of similar pathogens. By maintaining a dynamic classification system, public health preparedness efforts can shift away from a reactive, pathogen-specific focus toward a more anticipatory, trait-based strategy for managing future infectious disease risks.
